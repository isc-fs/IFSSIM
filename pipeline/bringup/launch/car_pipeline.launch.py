"""
Car pipeline — on-vehicle build. mode_manager + mission_control +
management trio + autonomy lifecycle nodes (odometry through control).

NO sim_supervisor (the on-vehicle uDV microcontroller replaces it as
the bridge between the autonomy and the actuators). NO IFSSIM /
foxglove / bag-recorder either — those are sim/dev concerns.

The autonomy still expects to find the same topics it consumes in
sim: /imu, /motor_rpm, /lidar/Lidar1, /odom, /testing_only/odom (the
last one only if a reference is available). On the car these are
provided by the uDV ROS bridge / LiDAR driver / VESC bridge running
in separate processes.

Usage:
  ros2 launch bringup car_pipeline.launch.py
